# Template Generic Repository C#  => Endpoint-Asp.net Core
Template Generic Repository In Onion Architecture 

*For better understanding many things are overlooked

*The Project Template Architechture Simplified

*You Can Change return Type To ResultDto<IEnumbrable<TEntity>> Or Anything You Preferred

*Message Error In Implmentaion Handled By Console , You Can Log it Or Anything You Preferred  

*In Application Layer , There Are Example How Use This Pattern
  
** If Find Any Error Or Idea Make This Implementaion Better Tell Me (:

 my only problem is that I still cannot make select in the form of a lambda expression, and it must be sent as a string, and in the implementation of this repository, different parts should be separated. And Now there is a possibility that the one who Write Service For Fetch Data Send Include With Unacceptable Format , of course there are possibilities to not write the names of the classes that we want to include as hard code, but the probability of error is still not low, if anyone can Make Select Generic With Lambda , I will be happy And Grateful
